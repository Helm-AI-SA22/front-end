In this work we report efficient four-wave mixing over micron-scale interaction lengths at telecoms wavelengths. We use an integrated plasmonic gap waveguide on silicon that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer in the gap. Our approach is so effective because the gap waveguide intensifies light by efficiently nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometres, generating a nonlinear response so strong that efficient four-wave mixing accumulates in just a micron.

The physics of optics and optoelectronics fundamentally addresses both interconnect energy and bandwidth density, and optics may be the only scalable solution to such problems. Here we summarize the corresponding background, status, opportunities, and research directions for optoelectronic technology and novel optics, including sub-femtojoule devices in waveguide and novel 2D array optical systems.

Beyond the elimination of line charging by the use optical connections, the next major interconnect dissipations are in the electronic circuits for receiver amplifiers, timing recovery and multiplexing. We can address these through the integration of photodetectors to reduce or eliminate receiver circuit energies, free-space optics to eliminate the need for timing and multiplexing circuits (while solving bandwidth density problems), and using optics generally to save power by running large synchronous systems.

The reflection and transmission are governed by the p-n junction smoothness, a parameter difficult to tune in conventional devices.

The constant dispersion function keeps electrons beyond the resonant energy bandwidth still being on resonant with the FEL radiation. Instead, in this paper, the case with focusing optics in an LPA-driven FEL using TGU is numerically studied, in which the dispersion function should be monotonously decreasing along the undulator. Even though the FEL resonance is not always satisfied for off-energy electrons in this case, through subtly optimizing the initial dispersion and focusing parameters, it is feasible to achieve a similar radiation power to the case assuming an ideal constant dispersion function without focusing optics, and meanwhile, to attain a good transverse coherence. Moreover, higher radiation power could be expected if longitudinally tapering, transverse-gradient variation in different sections are systematically conducted, which is demonstrated with intense global multiparameters optimizations based on GENESIS simulation.","authors":"G.

This is evidenced by the fact that the magnetic permeability of nearly all materials is unity in the optical frequency range, and that magneto-optical devices (such as Faraday isolators) must be large in order to allow for a sufficiently strong effect. In graphene, however, it has been shown that inhomogeneous strains can induce 'pseudomagnetic fields' that behave very similarly to real fields. Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that, by properly structuring a dielectric lattice, it is possible to induce a pseudomagnetic field at optical frequencies in a photonic lattice, where the propagation dynamics is equivalent to the evolution of an electronic wavepacket in graphene. To our knowledge, this is the first realization of a pseudomagnetic field in optics. The induced field gives rise to multiple photonic Landau levels (singularities in the density of states) separated by band gaps. We show experimentally and numerically that the gaps between these Landau levels give rise to transverse confinement of the optical modes. The use of strain allows for the exploration of magnetic effects in a non-resonant way that would be otherwise inaccessible in optics. Employing inhomogeneous strain to induce pseudomagnetism suggests the possibility that aperiodic photonic crystal structures can achieve greater field-enhancement and slow-light effects than periodic structures via the high density-of-states at Landau levels. Generalizing these concepts to other systems beyond optics, for example with matter waves in optical potentials, offers new intriguing physics that is fundamentally different from that in purely periodic structures.","authors":"Mikael C.

We demonstrate that a fully controllable phase plate building on Harald Rose's legacy in aberration correction and electron optics in general would open an exciting field of research and applications.","authors":"Giulio Guzzinati;Laura Clark;Armand B\u00e9ch\u00e9;Roeland Juchtmans;Ruben Van Boxem;Michael Mazilu;Jo Verbeeck","citationCount":-1,"id":"10.1016/j.ultramic.2014.10.007","openaccess":1,"pdfLink":"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.07294v2","publicationDate":"2015-04-27T22:30:12Z","source":["arxiv"],"title":"Prospects for versatile phase manipulation in the TEM: beyond aberration   correction","topics":[{"affinity":0.9894378781318665,"id":2}]},{"abstract":"Optimizing the system performance metric directly is an important method for correcting wave-front distortions in adaptive optics(AO) systems.

Nowadays, solid-state single-electron sources are key elements of the emerging new technologies of quantum information processing and single-electron electronics. Moreover, advanced research in free-electron quantum optics and developments in electron microscopy require the point sources of free electrons in vacuum, which can be controlled on a single electron level. However, up to now, single-electron vacuum guns were not realized in practice. The problems to be solved include the formation of stable tip-shaped heterostructured emitters and control of liberated electrons in time and energy domain. Here we overcome these challenges by creating a field emission (FE) electron source based on a carbon nanowire coupled to an ultra-sharp diamond tip by a tunnel junction. Using energy spectroscopy, we directly observe Coulomb oscillations of the electron Fermi level in the nanowire at room temperature and FE currents up to 1 $ mu$A. We reveal that the oscillations are suppressed at high FE current either by Joule heating or due to the high tunneling resistance, depending on the nanowire charging time, ranging from about 25 fs to 1 ps. We anticipate that the combination of introduced carbon single-electron sources with laser-induced gating is highly promising for the creation of coherent ultrashort free-electron bunches of interest for low-energy electron holography and ultrafast electron or X-ray imaging and spectroscopy.","authors":"Victor I.

Here we report how the macroscopic nonlinear-optical response of a heteronuclear crystal relates to the alignment and orientation of its chemical bonds. Substantial nonlinear emission is only observed if the electric field of an optical single-cycle pulse points from the less electronegative to the more electronegative element and not vice versa. This asymmetry is a consequence of the unbalanced real-space motion of valence charges along the direction of the bonds. These results connect a material's chemical structure to the optical response and may facilitate the comprehension and design of novel materials for applications in optics and lasers on basis of the atoms and how they connect.","authors":"Yuya Morimoto;Yasushi Shinohara;Mizuki Tani;Bo-Han Chen;Kenichi L.

Microwave photonics lends these advantages to electronic sensing and communication systems, but - unlike the field of nonlinear optics - electro-optic devices so far require classical modulation fields whose variance is dominated by electronic or thermal noise rather than quantum fluctuations. Here we present a cavity electro-optic transceiver operating in a millikelvin environment with a mode occupancy as low as 0.025 $ pm$ 0.005 noise photons. Our system is based on a lithium niobate whispering gallery mode resonator, resonantly coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity via the Pockels effect. For the highest continuous wave pump power of 1.48 mW we demonstrate bidirectional single-sideband conversion of X band microwave to C band telecom light with a total (internal) efficiency of 0.03 % (0.7 %) and an added output conversion noise of 5.5 photons. The high bandwidth of 10.7 MHz combined with the observed very slow heating rate of 1.1 noise photons s$^{-1}$ puts quantum limited pulsed microwave-optics conversion within reach. The presented device is versatile and compatible with superconducting qubits, which might open the way for fast and deterministic entanglement distribution between microwave and optical fields, for optically mediated remote entanglement of superconducting qubits, and for new multiplexed cryogenic circuit control and readout strategies.","authors":"William Hease;Alfredo Rueda;Rishabh Sahu;Matthias Wulf;Georg Arnold;Harald G.

Both processes have been previously investigated, but the collimation and focusing efficiency have been reported to be relatively low even in state-of-the-art ballistic pn-junction devices. These limitations prevented the realization of more advanced quantum devices based on electron-optical interference, while understanding of the underlying physics remains elusive. Here, we present a novel device architecture of a graphene microcavity defined by carefully-engineered local strain and electrostatic fields. We create a controlled electron-optic interference process at zero magnetic field as a consequence of consecutive Veselago refractions in the microcavity and provide direct experimental evidence through low-temperature electrical transport measurements. The experimentally observed first-, second-, and third-order interference peaks agree quantitatively with the Veselago physics in a microcavity. In addition, we demonstrate decoherence of the interference by an external magnetic field, as the cyclotron radius becomes comparable to the interference length scale. For its application in electron-optics, we utilize Veselago interference to localize uncollimated electrons and characterize its contribution in further improving collimation efficiency. Our work sheds new light on relativistic single-particle physics and provides important technical improvements toward next-generation quantum devices based on the coherent manipulation of electron momentum and trajectory.","authors":"Xi Zhang*;Wei Ren*;Elliot Bell;Ziyan Zhu;Kenji Watanabe;Takashi Taniguchi;Efthimios Kaxiras;Mitchell Luskin;Ke Wang","citationCount":-1,"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09651v1","openaccess":1,"pdfLink":"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09651v1","publicationDate":"2021-06-17T16:55:16Z","source":["arxiv"],"title":"Gate-tunable Veselago Interference in a Bipolar Graphene Microcavity","topics":[{"affinity":0.934887707233429,"id":2}]}]}
